//===========================================================================
// This file was modified as part of an ASP.NET 2.0 Web project conversion.
// The class name was changed and the class modified to inherit from the abstract base class 
// in file 'App_Code\Migrated\Stub_error_aspx_cs.cs'.
// During runtime, this allows other classes in your web application to bind and access 
// the code-behind page using the abstract base class.
// The associated content page 'error.aspx' was also modified to refer to the new class name.
// For more information on this code pattern, please refer to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=46995
